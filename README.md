# Project-Tiers
A tool to visualize, edit, and compare tier lists. Made to help my friends and me theorize about Super Smash Bros. tier lists because we're nerds :)

Supports creating new projects for different games, custom background per game, adding custom portraits for new characters, duplicating tier lists, tracking how much characters move throughout tier lists, editing tier groups, etc.
